# 100-000-UK-Used-Car-Data-set
Scraped data of used cars listings. 100,000 listings, which have been separated into files corresponding to each car manufacturer. I collected the data to make a tool to predict how much my friend should sell his old car for compared to other stuff on the market, and then just extended the data set. Then made a more general car value regression model.
